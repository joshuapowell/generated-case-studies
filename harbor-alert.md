As an environmentally focused entrepreneur with a focus on water, my work on Baltimore Water Watch formerly Blue Water Baltimore's Harbor Alert (https://baltimorewaterwatch.org) is directly related to water quality monitoring, assessment, and public awareness in the Baltimore area. Here's how Baltimore Water Watch contributes to water-related efforts:

1. Water quality monitoring: The platform supports routine monitoring of water quality at 49 stations in the rivers, streams, and harbor of the Patapsco River watershed[1].

2. Data collection and analysis: Baltimore Water Watch collects and synthesizes tens of thousands of individual data points annually to assess the health of regional waterways[1].

3. Health scoring system: The platform uses the collected data to calculate scores for the health of Baltimore's waters according to Mid-Atlantic Tributary Assessment Coalition (MTAC) protocol[1].

4. Comprehensive indicators: The system tracks multiple water quality indicators, including dissolved oxygen content in the Inner Harbor and conductivity levels in streams like Towson Run[1].

5. Long-term dataset: Baltimore Water Watch has been building a valuable long-term dataset since 2013, which is used by various stakeholders for informed decision-making about waterways[1].

6. Rapid bacteria testing: The platform incorporates new rapid bacteria testing methods for water samples from commonly used recreational sites in the Baltimore Harbor[1].

7. Public information: Baltimore Water Watch provides a Current Conditions map to share the most recent water quality readings with the public[1].

8. Supporting conservation efforts: The data collected serves as the scientific backbone for restoration, advocacy, outreach, and education work conducted by Blue Water Baltimore[1].

My work on Baltimore Water Watch demonstrates your commitment to leveraging technology and data to address water-related challenges. By creating a platform that enables comprehensive monitoring, analysis, and reporting of water quality in the Baltimore area, I've contributed to more effective water resource management and public awareness. This aligns with my focus on using innovative approaches to protect and improve water quality in urban environments.
