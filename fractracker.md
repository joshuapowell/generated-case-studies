As an environmentally focused designer and engineer with a focus on water, your work with FracTracker Alliance to build data visualizations and citizen science reporting tools has significant implications for both water and air quality, particularly in the context of oil and gas operations. Here's how this work relates to water and air:

1. Water quality monitoring: Your tools likely enable tracking and visualization of potential water contamination sources from fracking and other oil and gas activities, including:
   - Groundwater impacts from fracking fluids
   - Surface water pollution from spills or improper wastewater disposal
   - Impacts on watersheds near drilling sites

2. Air quality assessment: The data visualizations probably show air pollution sources from oil and gas operations, such as:
   - Methane emissions from wells and processing facilities
   - Volatile organic compound (VOC) releases
   - Particulate matter from flaring and other processes

3. Citizen science engagement: Your reporting tools empower community members to participate in environmental monitoring, collecting data on both water and air quality impacts in their areas.

4. Integrated environmental analysis: By combining data on water and air impacts, your visualizations likely demonstrate the interconnected nature of these environmental issues in the context of oil and gas extraction.

5. Public awareness: The tools you've developed serve to educate the public about potential risks to both water and air quality in communities near oil and gas operations.

6. Policy support: The data visualizations can inform policy decisions related to water and air quality protection measures in areas affected by fracking and other oil and gas activities.

7. Research facilitation: Your work provides valuable resources for researchers studying the relationships between oil and gas activities and their impacts on water and air quality.

8. Identification of at-risk areas: The visualizations likely help identify regions where water resources or air quality are particularly vulnerable to impacts from oil and gas operations.

9. Temporal analysis: Your tools may enable tracking of changes in water and air quality over time, correlating these changes with oil and gas activities.

10. Cross-media pollution tracking: By visualizing both water and air impacts, your work likely highlights how pollutants can transfer between these media (e.g., air pollutants settling into water bodies).

Your work with FracTracker Alliance demonstrates your commitment to leveraging data visualization and citizen science to address complex environmental challenges. By creating tools that highlight threats to both water and air quality from the oil and gas industry, you're contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of environmental issues and their interconnections. This aligns with your focus on using innovative approaches to improve environmental quality and engage communities in conservation efforts.
