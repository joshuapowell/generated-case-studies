## Background

When considering water from an environmental, conservation, restoration, and community perspective, you need to take into account several key categories and forms of water:

Freshwater ecosystems:

- Rivers and streams
- Lakes and ponds
- Wetlands (including marshes, swamps, and bogs)
- Groundwater systems

Coastal and marine ecosystems:

- Estuaries
- Coastal wetlands
- Shorelines
- Near-shore marine environments

Artificial water bodies:

- Reservoirs and dams
- Canals and irrigation systems
- Stormwater management structures

Precipitation and runoff:

- Rainwater
- Snowmelt
- Surface runoff

Water quality:

- Pollution levels
- Contaminants (e.g., nitrates, iron)
- Water treatment and purification

Water quantity:

- Water scarcity
- Drought conditions
- Flooding

Groundwater:

- Aquifers
- Water table levels
- Recharge rates

Climate change impacts:

- Sea level rise
- Changing precipitation patterns
- Extreme weather events

Community water resources:

- Drinking water supplies
- Agricultural water use
- Industrial water use

Traditional and cultural water systems:

- Indigenous water management practices
- Historical water infrastructure

Green infrastructure:

- Rain gardens
- Bioswales and rainscaping
- Permeable pavements and impervious surface removal
- Rainwater harvesting (i.e., rain barrels, cisterns)
- Conservation landscaping
- Green roof
- Tree planting

Restoration projects:

- Wetland restoration
- River and stream restoration
- Coastal habitat restoration
- Inland habitat restoration
- Streambank restoration
- Floodplain restoration
- Fish passage improvements
- Conservation easements
- Erosion control
- Riparian restoration (i.e., riparian grass buffer, riparian forest buffer)
- Livestock stream exclusion (i.e., livestock fencing)
- Stormwater runoff
- Other green infrastructure

When addressing water-related issues, it's crucial to consider these various forms and categories of water, as they are interconnected and play vital roles in ecosystem health, community well-being, and overall environmental sustainability. Conservation and restoration efforts should take a holistic approach, recognizing the complex relationships between different water systems and their impacts on both natural environments and human communities[1][2][4].
