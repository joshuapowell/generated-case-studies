As an environmentally focused entrepreneur with a focus on water, your work on Conservation Tracker (www.conservationtracker.org) is likely closely related to water conservation and management efforts. While I don't have specific information about Conservation Tracker from the search results provided, I can infer based on your background and similar platforms you've developed:

Conservation Tracker is a digital platform designed to support water conservation initiatives by:

1. Tracking water conservation projects: The platform likely allows users to document and monitor various water conservation efforts.

2. Data collection and analysis: It may provide tools for collecting, storing, and analyzing data related to water usage, conservation measures, and their impacts.

3. Progress monitoring: Users can likely track the progress of water conservation initiatives over time, helping to assess the effectiveness of different strategies.

4. Collaboration: The platform may facilitate collaboration between different stakeholders involved in water conservation efforts, such as environmental organizations, government agencies, and community groups.

5. Reporting: It likely includes features for generating reports on water conservation activities, which can be useful for grant reporting, policy-making, and public awareness.

6. Goal setting and achievement: Users may be able to set water conservation goals and track their progress towards achieving them.

7. Best practices sharing: The platform might allow users to share successful water conservation strategies and learn from each other's experiences.

Your work on Conservation Tracker demonstrates your commitment to leveraging technology to address water-related challenges. By creating tools that help track, analyze, and improve water conservation efforts, you're contributing to more effective and data-driven approaches to water resource management.

This approach aligns with your other projects like Water Reporter, which you developed as a "niche social network for individuals and environmental organizations to share and crowdsource information related to water observation"[1]. Conservation Tracker likely extends this concept to focus specifically on tracking and improving water conservation efforts.
