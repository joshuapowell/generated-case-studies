As an environmentally focused entrepreneur with a focus on water, my work on Ashtracker (www.ashtracker.org) is directly related to water quality and groundwater protection. Here's how Ashtracker contributes to water-related efforts:

1. Groundwater contamination monitoring: Ashtracker provides public access to industry-reported data about groundwater contamination at coal ash disposal sites throughout the United States[1][3]. This helps track and monitor water quality issues related to coal ash disposal.

2. Water quality data accessibility: The platform makes it easier for the public to access detailed information about groundwater contamination near areas used to dispose of ash, scrubber sludge, or other wastes from coal-burning power plants[1]. This increased transparency allows citizens to review data on specific concentrations of pollutants in groundwater.

3. Toxic pollutant tracking: Ashtracker focuses on monitoring pollutants such as arsenic, selenium, and lead that can accumulate in groundwater above federal drinking water standards and advisories[1]. These pollutants can have significant impacts on water quality and human health.

4. Environmental impact assessment: The platform helps identify and track contamination of groundwater and surface water from coal ash disposal sites, with the EPA determining that at least 157 of these sites have contaminated water resources[1].

5. Data compilation and analysis: Ashtracker compiles groundwater monitoring data from various sources, including state agencies, and presents it in an accessible format for public use and analysis[1].

6. Pollution risk awareness: By providing information on coal ash contamination, Ashtracker raises awareness about the potential risks to water resources, including rivers and streams, where contaminants may accumulate in sediment and the food chain[1].

7. Support for water protection efforts: The data provided by Ashtracker can be used by environmental organizations, researchers, and policymakers to support water protection initiatives and inform decision-making processes.

My work on Ashtracker demonstrates a commitment to leveraging technology and data transparency to address water-related challenges, particularly those associated with industrial pollution. By creating a platform that enables comprehensive tracking and reporting of groundwater contamination from coal ash disposal, I've contributed to more effective monitoring and protection of water resources.
